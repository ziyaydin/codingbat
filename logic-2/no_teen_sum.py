##Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule. In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main no_teen_sum()
#got help from: https://github.com/diezguerra/codingbat-python-solutions/blob/master/logic-2.py
def no_teen_sum(a, b, c):
  def fix_teen(n):
    return n if n not in [13,14,17,18,19] else 0

  return fix_teen(a)+fix_teen(b)+fix_teen(c)
